What if there is preceding text at zero indentation? Does it handle this well?

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-ejson-worker -->
<!--SNIPEND-->

For example, this paragraph starts at flush-left.

- However, certain items should not be dedented
  - For example, this list item on another level
- Another list item
